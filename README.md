# Frequency_of_one_number_in_given_inputs
In this problem, you will be given N numbers. You need to find the element which occurred
maximum number of times. If there are ties in frequencies, return the element which is
comparatively greater.
In the first line, you will be given an integer N. In the following line, you will be given N integer
values A i (1&lt;=i&lt;=N).
For each input there will be a single line of output. Printing the element with the maximum
number of occurrences. For ties in occurrences, print the element with the maximum value.
